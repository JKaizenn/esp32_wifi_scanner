# Simple Wifi Scanner using ESP32 and Arduino.h Wifi Library in C++

## So far this tool:
- Scans for local networks
- Sorts Networks by signal strength (rssi)
- Displays SSID, RSSI, and Channel

## Future Uses:
I plan on adding a proper scan feature that can also connect the device to the local network.
